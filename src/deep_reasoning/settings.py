"""Settings: the providers a chat's model runs on, their keys, the custom servers, and the
folder new chats work in.

Keys live in .env in the app's home, readable only by you: never in the app file, a chat,
a run's folder, an event, a log or a response. A key saved there wins over the same
variable in the shell. The custom servers, the model picked last and the default folder,
none of it secret, live in the app file's app_settings table, so a copy of the file
carries them. A custom server's key, saved or from the shell, goes only to the address
recorded beside it in .env when the server was saved here: a shared file's server may
borrow the name of one of yours.
