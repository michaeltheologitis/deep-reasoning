"""Runs: each message is one run of deep_reasoner in a worker subprocess, streamed as events.

A run's events are in the app file, saved as they happen, so a copy of the file carries
every chat's past turns: the runs table names each run's chat, and the events table holds
each event as the JSON the page folds. The server numbers each event (seq, from 1) and
stamps its time (t). runs/<run>/ in the file's data folder holds the run's working files:
spec.yaml, what the worker runs, with the engine config; worker.log, the worker's stderr;
and what the engine writes. The model's key reaches the worker in its environment only,
never the run's folder or the file. The worker works in the chat's folder: its cwd, where
the agent's Python reads and writes.
